// REVIEW: Instead of a global `articles = []` array, let's attach this list of all articles directly to the constructor function. Note: it is NOT on the prototype. In JavaScript, functions are themselves objects, which means we can add properties/values to them at any time. In this case, the array relates to ALL of the Article objects, so it does not belong on the prototype, as that would only be relevant to a single instantiated Article.
Article.all = [];

// COMMENT: Why isn't this method written as an arrow function?
// contextual this is being utilized, so arrow function cannot be used.
Article.prototype.toHtml = function() {
  let template = Handlebars.compile($('#article-template').text());

  this.daysAgo = parseInt((new Date() - new Date(this.publishedOn))/60/60/24/1000);

  // COMMENT: What is going on in the line below? What do the question mark and colon represent? How have we seen this same logic represented previously?
  // Not sure? Check the docs!
  // it is a ternary operator and ? mark is a shortcut for the if statement.
  // we have seen this as if else statements.

};

// REVIEW: There are some other functions that also relate to all articles across the board, rather than just single instances. Object-oriented programming would call these "class-level" functions, that are relevant to the entire "class" of objects that are Articles.

// REVIEW: This function will take the rawData, how ever it is provided, and use it to instantiate all the articles. This code is moved from elsewhere, and encapsulated in a simply-named function for clarity.

// COMMENT: Where is this function called? What does 'rawData' represent now? How is this different from previous labs?
// it is called at Article.fetchAll(). rawData is article data stored in local storage.
Article.loadAll = rawData => {
  rawData.sort((a,b) => (new Date(b.publishedOn)) - (new Date(a.publishedOn)))

  rawData.forEach(articleObject => Article.all.push(new Article(articleObject)))
}

// REVIEW: This function will retrieve the data from either a local or remote source, and process it, then hand off control to the View.
Article.fetchAll = () => {
  // REVIEW: What is this 'if' statement checking for? Where was the rawData set to local storage?
  //if statement is checking if rawData is present in local storage and if there is no rawData in local storage it will fetch the data from JSON file and in the process save that data into local storage.
